# Bike-Sharing
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## General Information
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

The company wants to know:

1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.?
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands?

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
The analysis conducted on the bicycle sharing dataset identified several key features that significantly influence the demand for bikes: year, windspeed, season (specifically summer and winter), weather conditions (mist and light snow), month (especially September), and day of the week (Sunday). These variables, when incorporated into a model, can provide valuable insights for predicting bike rental demand.
Based on the Analysis , 

Further Analysis: 
1. Holiday is removed from model , But Investigation on special events may give further insight if data is available
2. Exploring the influence of geographical factors (e.g., location, terrain) if available in the dataset.
3. Incorporating time-series analysis techniques to capture temporal patterns and trends.Also check its impact on casual and registered bike counts.
